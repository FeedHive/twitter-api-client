        description: |
          Allows a Consumer application to use an OAuth request_token to request user authorization. 
          This method is a replacement of Section 6.2 of the OAuth 1.0 authentication flow for applications 
          using the callback authentication flow. The method will use the currently logged in user as the account 
          for access authorization unless the force_login parameter is set to true.This method differs from 
          GET oauth / authorize in that if the user has already granted the application permission, 
          the redirect will occur without the user having to re-approve the application. 
          To realize this behavior, you must enable the Use Sign in with Twitter setting on your application record.

        resourceUrl: https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize
        description: |
          Allows a Consumer application to use an OAuth Request Token to request user authorization. 
          This method fulfills Section 6.2 of the OAuth 1.0 authentication flow. 
          Desktop applications must use this method (and cannot use GET oauth / authenticate).
          Usage Note: An oauth_callback is never sent to this method, provide it to POST oauth / request_token instead.
        parameters:
          - name: force_login

        resourceUrl: https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token
        description: |
          Allows a Consumer application to exchange the OAuth Request Token for an
          OAuth Access Token. This method fulfills Section 6.3 of the OAuth 1.0 authentication flow.
        parameters:
          - name: oauth_verifier
            description: |
              If using the OAuth web-flow, set this parameter to the value of the oauth_verifier
              returned in the callback URL. If you are using out-of-band OAuth, set this value to the pin-code.
              For OAuth 1.0a compliance this parameter is required. OAuth 1.0a is strictly enforced
              and applications not using the oauth_verifier will fail to complete the OAuth flow.
            required: false
            type: string

        description: |
          Allows a registered application to revoke an issued OAuth access_token 
          by presenting its client credentials. Once an access_token has been invalidated, 
          new creation attempts will yield a different Access Token and usage of 
          the invalidated token will no longer be allowed.
        parameters:
          - name: access_token
            description: The access_token of user to be invalidated

        description: |
          Allows a registered application to revoke an issued oAuth 2.0 Bearer Token by presenting 
          its client credentials. Once a Bearer Token has been invalidated, new creation 
          attempts will yield a different Bearer Token and usage of the invalidated 
          token will no longer be allowed.Successful responses include a 
          JSON-structure describing the revoked Bearer Token.
        parameters:
          - name: access_token
            description: The value of the bearer token to revoke
            required: true

        description: |
          Allows a Consumer application to obtain an OAuth Request Token to request user authorization. 
          This method fulfills Section 6.1 of the OAuth 1.0 authentication flow.
        parameters:
          - name: oauth_callback
            description: |
              For OAuth 1.0a compliance this parameter is required.
              The value you specify here will be used as the URL a user is redirected to should they approve
              your application's access to their account. Set this to oob for out-of-band pin mode.
              This is also how you specify custom callbacks for use in desktop/mobile applications.
              Always send an oauth_callback on this step, regardless of a pre-registered callback.
              We require that any callback URL used with this endpoint will have to be
              whitelisted within the app settings on developer.twitter.com*
            required: false
            type: string
          - name: x_auth_access_type
            description: |
              Overrides the access level an application requests to a users account.
              Supported values are read or write. This parameter is intended to allow a developer to
              register a read/write application but also request read only access when appropriate.
            required: false
            type: string
        exampleResponse: |
          {

      - title: POST oauth2/token
        url: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/api-reference/token
        resourceUrl: https://api.twitter.com/oauth2/token
        description: |
          Allows a registered application to obtain an OAuth 2 Bearer Token, 
          which can be used to make API requests on an application's own behalf, 
          without a user context. This is called Application-only authentication.
          A Bearer Token may be invalidated using oauth2/invalidate_token. 
          Once a Bearer Token has been invalidated, new creation attempts will yield a different Bearer Token and 
          usage of the previous token will no longer be allowed.
          Only one bearer token may exist outstanding for an application, and repeated requests to this method 
          will yield the same already-existent token until it has been invalidated.
          Successful responses include a JSON-structure describing the awarded Bearer Token.
          Tokens received by this method should be cached. 
          If attempted too frequently, requests will be rejected with a HTTP 403 with code 99.
        parameters:
          - name: grant_type
            description: |
              Specifies the type of grant being requested by the application.
              At this time, only client_credentials is allowed. See Application-Only Authentication
              for more information.
            required: true
