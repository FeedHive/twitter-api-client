          Use this endpoint to upload images to Twitter.
          This endpoint returns a media_id by default and can optionally return a media_key
          when a media_category is specified. These values are used by Twitter endpoints that accept images.
          For example, a media_id value can be used to create a Tweet with an
          attached photo using the POST statuses/update endpoint.
          All Ads API endpoints require a media_key.
          For example, a media_key value can be used to create a Draft Tweet
          with a photo using the POST accounts/:account_id/draft_tweets endpoint.
