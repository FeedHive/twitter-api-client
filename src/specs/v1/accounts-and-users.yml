        description: |
          Returns all lists the authenticating or specified user subscribes to, 
          including their own. The user is specified using the user_id or screen_name parameters. 
          If no user is given, the authenticating user is used.A maximum of 100 results will be 
          returned by this call. Subscribed lists are returned first, followed by owned lists. 
          This means that if a user subscribes to 90 lists and owns 20 lists, this method returns 
          90 subscriptions and 10 owned lists. The reverse method returns owned lists first, 
          so with reverse=true, 20 owned lists and 80 subscriptions would be returned. 
          If your goal is to obtain every list a user owns or subscribes to, 
          use GET lists / ownerships and/or GET lists / subscriptions instead.

          Returns a cursored collection of user IDs for every user following the specified user.
          At this time, results are ordered with the most recent following first — however, 
          this ordering is subject to unannounced change and eventual consistency issues. Results are 
          given in groups of 5,000 user IDs and multiple "pages" of results can be navigated through 
          using the next_cursor value in subsequent requests. See Using cursors to navigate 
          collections for more information.This method is especially powerful when used in 
          conjunction with GET users / lookup, a method that allows 
          you to convert user IDs into full user objects in bulk.

          Returns fully-hydrated user objects for up to 100 users per request, as specified by comma-separated values passed to the user_id and/or screen_name parameters.This method is especially useful when used in conjunction with collections of user IDs returned from GET friends / ids and GET followers / ids.GET users / show is used to retrieve a single user object.There are a few things to note when using this method.
          You must be following a protected user to be able to see their most recent status update. If you don't follow a protected user their status will be removed.
          The order of user IDs or screen names may not match the order of users in the returned array.
          If a requested user is unknown, suspended, or deleted, then that user will not be returned in the results list.
          If none of your lookup criteria can be satisfied by returning a user object, a HTTP 404 will be thrown.
          You are strongly encouraged to use a POST for larger requests.
