          Retrieve the identified Collection, presented as a list of the Tweets curated within.
          The response structure of this method differs significantly from timelines you 
          may be used to working with elsewhere in the Twitter API.To navigate a Collection, 
          use the position object of a response, which includes attributes for max_position, 
          min_position, and was_truncated. was_truncated indicates whether additional 
          Tweets exist in the collection outside of the range of the current request. 
          To retrieve Tweets further back in time, use the value of min_position found 
          in the current response as the max_position parameter in the next call to this endpoint.

        parameters:

              Specifies the number of records to retrieve. Must be less than
              or equal to 200. Defaults to 20. The value of count is best thought of as
              a limit to the number of tweets to return because suspended or deleted content

          This is in addition to existing user-level rate limits (75 requests / 15-minutes). 
          This limit is enforced on a per-application basis, meaning that a

          Returns fully-hydrated Tweet objects for up to 100 Tweets per request, as specified by comma-separated values passed to the id parameter.This method is especially useful to get the details (hydrate) a collection of Tweet IDs.GET statuses / show / :id is used to retrieve a single Tweet object.There are a few things to note when using this method.
          You must be following a protected user to be able to see their most recent Tweets. If you don't follow a protected user their status will be removed.
          The order of Tweet IDs may not match the order of Tweets in the returned array.
          If a requested Tweet is unknown or deleted, then that Tweet will not be returned in the results list, unless the map parameter is set to true, in which case it will be returned with a value of null.
          If none of your lookup criteria matches valid Tweet IDs an empty array will be returned for map=false.
          You are strongly encouraged to use a POST for larger requests.

        resourceUrl: https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update.json
        description: |
          Updates the authenticating user's current status, also known as Tweeting.
          For each update attempt, the update text is compared with the authenticating 
          user's recent Tweets. Any attempt that would result in duplication will be 
          blocked, resulting in a 403 error. A user cannot submit the same status twice in a row.
          While not rate limited by the API, a user is limited in the number of Tweets they 
          can create at a time. If the number of updates posted by the user reaches the current 
          allowed limit this method will return an HTTP 403 error.About Geo
          Any geo-tagging parameters in the update will be ignored if geo_enabled for the user 
          is false (this is the default setting for all users, unless the user has enabled geolocation in their settings)
          The number of digits after the decimal separator passed to lat (up to 8) is tracked so that 
          when the lat is returned in a status object it will have the same number of digits 
          after the decimal separator.
          Use a decimal point as the separator (and not a decimal comma) for the latitude and the longitude 
          - usage of a decimal comma will cause the geo-tagged portion of the status update to be dropped.
          For JSON, the response mostly uses conventions described in GeoJSON. However, 
          the geo object coordinates that Twitter renders are reversed from the GeoJSON specification. 
          GeoJSON specifies a longitude then a latitude, whereas Twitter represents it as a latitude then 
          a longitude: "geo": { "type":"Point", "coordinates":[37.78217, -122.40062] }
          The coordinates object is replacing the geo object (no deprecation date has been set for the geo 
          object yet) -- the difference is that the coordinates object, in JSON, is now rendered correctly in GeoJSON.
          If a place_id is passed into the status update, then that place will be attached 
          to the status. If no place_id was explicitly provided, but latitude and longitude 
          are, the API attempts to implicitly provide a place by calling geo/reverse_geocode.
          Users have the ability to remove all geotags from all their Tweets en masse via the 
          user settings page. Currently there is no method to remove geotags from individual Tweets.

              This wil append @mentions into the metadata of an extended Tweet as a reply chain grows,
