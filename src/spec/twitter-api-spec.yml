          description: |
            Allows a Consumer application to use an OAuth request_token to request user authorization. 
            This method is a replacement of Section 6.2 of the OAuth 1.0 authentication flow for applications 
            using the callback authentication flow. The method will use the currently logged in user as the account 
            for access authorization unless the force_login parameter is set to true.This method differs from 
            GET oauth / authorize in that if the user has already granted the application permission, 
            the redirect will occur without the user having to re-approve the application. 
            To realize this behavior, you must enable the Use Sign in with Twitter setting on your application record.

          description: |
            Allows a Consumer application to use an OAuth Request Token to request user authorization. 
            This method fulfills Section 6.2 of the OAuth 1.0 authentication flow. 
            Desktop applications must use this method (and cannot use GET oauth / authenticate).
            Usage Note: An oauth_callback is never sent to this method, provide it to POST oauth / request_token instead.

          description: |
            Allows a registered application to revoke an issued OAuth access_token 
            by presenting its client credentials. Once an access_token has been invalidated, 
            new creation attempts will yield a different Access Token and usage of 
            the invalidated token will no longer be allowed.

          description: |
            Allows a registered application to revoke an issued oAuth 2.0 Bearer Token by presenting 
            its client credentials. Once a Bearer Token has been invalidated, new creation 
            attempts will yield a different Bearer Token and usage of the invalidated 
            token will no longer be allowed.Successful responses include a 
            JSON-structure describing the revoked Bearer Token.
          exampleResponse: |
            { "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN" }

          resourceUrl: https://api.twitter.com/oauth2/token
          description: |
            Allows a registered application to obtain an OAuth 2 Bearer Token, 
            which can be used to make API requests on an application's own behalf, 
            without a user context. This is called Application-only authentication.
            A Bearer Token may be invalidated using oauth2/invalidate_token. 
            Once a Bearer Token has been invalidated, new creation attempts will yield a different Bearer Token and 
            usage of the previous token will no longer be allowed.
            Only one bearer token may exist outstanding for an application, and repeated requests to this method 
            will yield the same already-existent token until it has been invalidated.
            Successful responses include a JSON-structure describing the awarded Bearer Token.
            Tokens received by this method should be cached. 
            If attempted too frequently, requests will be rejected with a HTTP 403 with code 99.
          parameters:
            - name: grant_type
              description: |
                Specifies the type of grant being requested by the application.
                At this time, only client_credentials is allowed. See Application-Only Authentication
                for more information.

          url: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/get-lists-list
          resourceUrl: https://api.twitter.com/1.1/lists/list.json
          description: |
            Returns all lists the authenticating or specified user subscribes to, 
            including their own. The user is specified using the user_id or screen_name parameters. 
            If no user is given, the authenticating user is used.A maximum of 100 results will be 
            returned by this call. Subscribed lists are returned first, followed by owned lists. 
            This means that if a user subscribes to 90 lists and owns 20 lists, this method returns 
            90 subscriptions and 10 owned lists. The reverse method returns owned lists first, 
            so with reverse=true, 20 owned lists and 80 subscriptions would be returned. 
            If your goal is to obtain every list a user owns or subscribes to, 
            use GET lists / ownerships and/or GET lists / subscriptions instead.

            Removes multiple members from a list, by specifying a comma-separated list 
            of member ids or screen names. The authenticated user must own the list to 
            be able to remove members from it. Note that lists can't have more 
            than 500 members, and you are limited to removing up to 100 members to a 
            list at a time with this method.Please note that there can be issues with 
            lists that rapidly remove and add memberships. Take care when using these methods 
            such that you are not too rapidly switching between removals and adds on the same list.

            The response structure of this method differs significantly from timelines you 
            may be used to working with elsewhere in the Twitter API.To navigate a Collection, 
            use the position object of a response, which includes attributes for max_position, 
            min_position, and was_truncated. was_truncated indicates whether additional 
            Tweets exist in the collection outside of the range of the current request. 
            To retrieve Tweets further back in time, use the value of min_position found 
            in the current response as the max_position parameter in the next call to this endpoint.

                filtered out after connections are queried. If no cursor is provided, a value 
                of -1 will be assumed, which is the first "page." The response from the API 
                will include a previous_cursor and next_cursor to allow paging back and forth. 
                See our cursor docs for more information. While this method supports the cursor parameter, 
                the entire result set can be returned in a single cursored collection. Using the count 
                parameter with this method will not provide segmented cursors for use with this parameter.

          description: |
            Updates the authenticating user's current status, also known as Tweeting.
            For each update attempt, the update text is compared with the authenticating 
            user's recent Tweets. Any attempt that would result in duplication will be 
            blocked, resulting in a 403 error. A user cannot submit the same status twice in a row.
            While not rate limited by the API, a user is limited in the number of Tweets they 
            can create at a time. If the number of updates posted by the user reaches the current 
            allowed limit this method will return an HTTP 403 error.About Geo
            Any geo-tagging parameters in the update will be ignored if geo_enabled for the user 
            is false (this is the default setting for all users, unless the user has enabled geolocation in their settings)
            The number of digits after the decimal separator passed to lat (up to 8) is tracked so that 
            when the lat is returned in a status object it will have the same number of digits 
            after the decimal separator.
            Use a decimal point as the separator (and not a decimal comma) for the latitude and the longitude 
            - usage of a decimal comma will cause the geo-tagged portion of the status update to be dropped.
            For JSON, the response mostly uses conventions described in GeoJSON. However, 
            the geo object coordinates that Twitter renders are reversed from the GeoJSON specification. 
            GeoJSON specifies a longitude then a latitude, whereas Twitter represents it as a latitude then 
            a longitude: "geo": { "type":"Point", "coordinates":[37.78217, -122.40062] }
            The coordinates object is replacing the geo object (no deprecation date has been set for the geo 
            object yet) -- the difference is that the coordinates object, in JSON, is now rendered correctly in GeoJSON.
            If a place_id is passed into the status update, then that place will be attached 
            to the status. If no place_id was explicitly provided, but latitude and longitude 
            are, the API attempts to implicitly provide a place by calling geo/reverse_geocode.
            Users have the ability to remove all geotags from all their Tweets en masse via the 
            user settings page. Currently there is no method to remove geotags from individual Tweets.

            Search for places that can be attached to a Tweet via POST statuses/update. Given a latitude and a longitude pair, an IP address, or a name, this request will return a list of all the valid places that can be used as the place_id when updating a status.Conceptually, a query can be made from the user's location, retrieve a list of places, have the user validate the location they are at, and then send the ID of this location with a call to POST statuses/update.This is the recommended method to use find places that can be attached to statuses/update. Unlike GET geo/reverse_geocode which provides raw data access, this endpoint can potentially re-order places with regards to the user who is authenticated. This approach is also preferred for interactive place matching with the user.Some parameters in this method are only required based on the existence of other parameters. For instance, "lat" is required if "long" is provided, and vice-versa. Authentication is recommended, but not required with this method.
